### What I'll Have to Learn

Will be laerning quite a lot about api's, and intergrating them into my site this will by far be the biggest learnign curve for me, as I will be using 3 different ones possibly. 
I haven't added audio or video to a site page yet, this will also be new for me.
I will have to dive quite a bit deeper into springboot's documentation to get this to all work properly.
